# File menager

Created by own idea - based on os and shutil libs - during development file (check out dev branch)

## Features already implemented
* put files to dedicated dirs - .xlsx to excel dir
  * if dir exists put it there
  * otherwise create one
    * if there is file with same name - add dash at the end of name
* remove empty dirs
* move other dirs to dir for dirs
* other extentions put to the same dir
* customisable extentions for dirs (working on user method instead of editing source code)
